# C++ Programming Undergraduate Coursework

This repository showcases the programming assignments from the **C++ Programming** course taken during the first year of my undergraduate studies.  
The course focused on developing a solid foundation in software development using C++.

Each subfolder contains a summary of the problem statements and their corresponding code implementations from each lecture.

# C++ Programming Undergraduate Coursework

This repository showcases the programming assignments from the **C++ Programming** course taken during the first year of my undergraduate studies.  
The course focused on developing a solid foundation in software development using C++.

Each subfolder contains the corresponding code implementations from each lecture.

The summary of the problem statements for each assignment will be stated below.

## Problems (summarized)

#### 1. 
1. Make a program to read in an integer that represents a length expressed in centimeters, and then converts it to US customary units of feet and inches.

2. Make a program to find all solutions for a Diophantine equation for a predefined domain.

3. Design a Student class that reads student scores from a file, calculates their average and letter grade, and prints the results.

4. Extend the Student class to handle more data, then read a file to calculate total scores, generate grades, and print a formatted grade report with searching and ranking features.

5. Extend the Student class to read student records, calculate averages, use switch statements to convert averages to letter grades, and generate a grade report counting each letter grade.

6. Simulate fair and biased 5-dice rolls, rank each roll, and compare winning percentages of fair vs. biased dice over millions of games.

7. Design a program that can generate all possible permutations for a given data set using Pandita algorithm.

8. Design a program to calculate the determinant of an n-dimensional array.

9. Create a class that stores a number and its prime factorization, provides a method to display it, and includes functions to compute and return the GCD and LCM of two numbers as objects containing both the value and its prime factors.

10. Create a class that stores a number using a linked list of structures holding prime factors and their powers, provides a method to display the factorization along with memory addresses, and includes functions to compute and return the GCD and LCM of two numbers as objects containing both the value and its prime factors.

# C++ Programming Undergraduate Coursework

This repository showcases the programming assignments from the **C++ Programming** course taken during the first year of my undergraduate studies.  
The course focused on developing a solid foundation in software development using C++.

Each subfolder contains the corresponding code implementations from each lecture.

The summaries of the problem statements for each assignment are provided below.

## Problems (summarized)

### 1. Unit Conversion
Make a program to read in an integer that represents a length expressed in centimeters, and then converts it to US customary units of feet and inches.

### 2. Solving a Diophantine Equation
Make a program to find all solutions for a Diophantine equation for a predefined domain.

### 3. Design of Student class
Design a Student class that reads student scores from a file, calculates their average and letter grade, and prints the results.

### 4. Read and Find the Top 3 Highest
Extend the Student class to handle more data, then read a file to calculate total scores, generate grades, and print a formatted grade report with searching and ranking features.

### 5. Compact a Student Object and Print GPA
Extend the Student class to read student records, calculate averages, use switch statements to convert averages to letter grades, and generate a grade report counting each letter grade.

### 6. Dice Poker Game
Simulate fair and biased 5-dice rolls, rank each roll, and compare winning percentages of fair vs. biased dice over millions of games.

### 7. Permutations
Design a program that can generate all possible permutations for a given data set using Pandita algorithm.

### 8. Matrix Determinant
Design a program to calculate the determinant of an n-dimensional array.

### 9. GCD and LCM
Create a class that stores a number and its prime factorization, provides a method to display it, and includes functions to compute and return the GCD and LCM of two numbers as objects containing both the value and its prime factors.

### 10. Structure and Pointer
Create a class that stores a number using a linked list of structures holding prime factors and their powers, provides a method to display the factorization along with memory addresses, and includes functions to compute and return the GCD and LCM of two numbers as objects containing both the value and its prime factors.

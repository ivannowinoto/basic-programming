# C++ Laboratory Undergraduate Coursework

This folder contains programming exercises and assignments from the **C++ Programming Laboratory** course, completed during the first year of my undergraduate studies.  
This course is designed to strengthen and extend the foundational programming skills acquired in the **C++ Programming** course.

Each subfolder corresponds to one week of coursework and includes the problem statements and source code implementations.

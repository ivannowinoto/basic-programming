1. Enter the number of array first, then input each element of the array, then input the start point and tolerance. If the member of the array is composed of the starting point and its arithmetic sequence, output True, otherwise output False.
    Sample 1:
    6
    4 2 8 6 10 0
    0 2
    Ans:

    Sample 2:
    4
    1 3 7 6
    1 2
    Ans:
    False

2. Enter the number of array first, then input each element of the array. Then enter an integer representing the value to be searched, and output the number of values to be searched in the array.
    Simple 1:
    5

    Simple 2:
    4
    1 2 3 4
    0
    Ans:
    0

3. Enter the number of elements first, then input each element of the array. Then check that there are several different integers in the array, and output the number. 
Note: the input element will not be 0.

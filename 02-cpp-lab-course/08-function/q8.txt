1. Define a function: int checkAnswer(int *sheet, int *ans).
    The exam paper has five multiple choice questions (options are ABCD), first enter the student's answer to 5 questions, then enter the correct answer to 5 questions, each question is 20 points, return the score to the main function and output it.
    Sample:
    A C D B A
    B C D B B
    Ans:
    60

2. Define a function: void mix(int *a, int *b, int *c, int size)
    The input value is the length of the a and b arrays. This function will mix the a and b arrays into an empty array named c. The elements of the a array are placed at positions 1, 3, 5, 7..., and the elements of the b array are placed at positions 0, 2, 4, 6....
    First enter the value size to indicate the length of a and b, and then enter the elements of the a array and the b array in sequence, and then call this function, output the c array in the main function.
    Sample:
    5 (the length of the a, b arrays)
    1 3 5 7 9(elements of a)
    2 4 6 8 10(elements of b)
    Ans:
    2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 10 9 (elements of c)

3. Define a function: void shiftString(char *str, int shift)
    str is an unencrypted string; shift is the value to move forward;
    Enter a string that needs to be encrypted, and then enter the value to be offset, and then call this function to output the encrypted string in the main function.
    Sample:
    ABCDE
    3
    Ans:
    DEFGH

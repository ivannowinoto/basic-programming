1. fight.py

    Objective:
    Create a text-based battle game where the Hero (勇者) fights the Demon King (魔王). Both characters attack each other in turns until one of their HP reaches zero.

    Requirements:
    1) Classes for Characters
        a. class Hero
            Attributes: HP, skills (3 different attacks with random damage ranges)
            Methods:
                a) Attack method that calculates damage for each skill
                b) Apply floating multiplier to vary the actual damage
                c) Display damage dealt
        b. class DemonKing
            Attributes: HP, fixed attack value
            Methods:
                a) Attack method that applies damage to Hero (with floating multiplier)
                b) Display damage dealt
    2) Battle Flow
        a. Each round, the Hero attacks first using a skill of choice.
        b. Calculate and reduce Demon King’s HP based on Hero’s attack.
        c. Check if Demon King’s HP ≤ 0 → Hero wins.
        d. If Demon King still alive, Demon King attacks Hero.
        e. Reduce Hero’s HP based on Demon King’s attack.
        f. Check if Hero’s HP ≤ 0 → Demon King wins.
        g. Repeat rounds until one HP reaches 0.
    3) Gameplay Features
        a. Display damage for each skill.
        b. Display Hero’s attack damage.
        c. Display Demon King’s attack damage.
        d. Show remaining HP for both Hero and Demon King after each attack.
        e. Randomize damage ranges for Hero’s skills (100–180) and include a floating multiplier (0.3–1.5).
        f. Demon King’s attack is fixed (10) but can also have a floating multiplier.
    4) Optional / Additional
        a. Allow player to choose skills by number.
        b. Display a victory message (WIN or LOSE) depending on who reaches 0 HP first.
        c. Use clear formatting so it is easy to read the battle log in the console.


2. voucher.py

    Objective:
    Write a Python program to check if a user's phone number qualifies for an 80% discount voucher.

    Requirements:
    1) The program repeatedly asks the user to input a phone number.
    2) The phone number must be 10 digits and start with 09.
    3) Mask digits 4–6 of the phone number with * to protect privacy.
    4) Check if the phone number contains the digits 2 or 8 anywhere.
    5) If it contains 2 or 8, print that the user gets the 80% discount voucher.
    6) Display:
        a. Last three digits of the phone number
        b. Masked phone number
        c. Whether it qualifies for the discount
    7) Use Python data structures:
        a. List for reading/manipulating the phone number
        b. len() to check phone number length
        c. List indexing to mask digits and check start of number
        d. Set {} to check if digits 2 or 8 are present


3. average.py

    Objective:
    Write a Python program that allows users to input course information and continuously calculates the current GPA/average.

    Requirements:
    1) The user can input course name, grade, and credit repeatedly.
    2) Store each course’s information using a dictionary (dict).
    3) After each new course entry, calculate and display the current overall average.
    4) The program should allow continuous input of course information until the user decides to stop.


4. score.py 

    Objective:
    Write a Python program to simulate exam scores for a class and analyze pass rates.

    Requirements:
    1) The user inputs number of students N (1–9999).
    2) Generate random scores (0–100) for Math and English for each student.
    3) Each student has a student ID in the format 110xxxx (e.g., N=1 → 1100001, N=9999 → 1109999).
    4) Use dictionaries to store scores:
        e.g., math[student_id] = score, english[student_id] = score
    5) Use sets to calculate and output:
        a. Number of students who passed both subjects and their IDs
        b. Number of students who passed only one subject and their IDs
        c. Number of students who passed only English and their IDs
        d. Number of students who passed only Math and their IDs
        e. Math pass rate
        f. English pass rate
        g. Overall pass rate for both subjects
